#Lunaris Sentient Core

## Introduction

**Lunaris Sentient Core** is an advanced system designed to provide security and protection to the **Moon Cloud Services** infrastructure, ensuring the protection of servers against cyber attacks and malware. Combining real-time monitoring and robust encryption, Lunaris acts as the first line of defense for digital security.

## Features

- **Traffic Monitoring**: Lunaris constantly monitors data traffic between servers, analyzing patterns and detecting anomalies.

- **Malware Protection**: Using advanced detection techniques, Lunaris identifies and neutralizes malware threats before they can cause damage.

- **DDoS Protection**: The system is designed to mitigate DDoS attacks, protecting the availability of Moon Cloud Services.

- **Secure Communication**: All data between servers is transmitted securely using AES-256 and WireGuard encryption, allowing Lunaris to make informed decisions about the state of the infrastructure.

**Technologies Used**

* **Programming Singuage:** Python

* **Frameworks and Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Flask (for API), Pandas (for data manipulation)

* **Infrastructure:** Based on the Llama 3.2 model with 90 billion parameters, running on a robust and scalable infrastructure.

* ## Installation

Lunaris cannot be installed on any computer. It was designed to run on a specific infrastructure. For installation and configuration, those interested should contact **Moon Cloud Services**, where our specialized team will perform the necessary installation and adaptation. Future developments may allow greater installation flexibility.

## Examples of Use

Lunaris must be operated on a single server that is not connected to the internet, ensuring maximum security. The system can be configured to protect multiple servers in an infrastructure, collecting traffic and operating system information. The analysis process includes:

1. **Traffic Analysis**: Lunaris analyzes traffic for anomalous patterns.

2. **Server State Classification**: The server is marked as "Ok" if it is normal or "Previously Violated Security" if an attack is detected.

3. **Response to Incidents**: In case of an attack, Lunaris will block traffic and perform a detailed analysis, reviewing files, checking the kernel, and fixing problems automatically.
